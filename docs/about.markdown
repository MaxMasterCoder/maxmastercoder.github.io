Hello. I am Max Rodríguez Güell. You probably found this tiny corner of the internet through my  
mods on modrinth or curseforge. I started programming when I was 9 years old and have been obssesed with it ever since.  
In that time I have learned how to code in both Python and Java.  
  
I now code minecraft mods. I try to support both Forge and Fabric but really, Fabric is just superior (in my opinion). Thanks  
for reading for this long and please enjoy my mods.  
  
Thanks,  
Max
